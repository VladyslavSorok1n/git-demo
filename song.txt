Tonight we fight with fire in our eyes
There is no break from endless war we cannot rest tonight
The siege tower will guide us into battle
Commission armor from the blacksmith for the horse I straddle
I salute the castle high up on the hill
I pray for my family as I go in for the kill
My sharpened battle axe
Artillery prepped to attack
Trebuchet loaded and pulled back
Siege tower approaching sky goes black

Inch by inch, inch by inch
The siege tower crawls across the battle field
Inch by inch, inch by inch
The siege tower crawls across the battlefield
